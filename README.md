# system-config

My configs for workspaces in Ubuntu, Windows and WSL

# Ubuntu

To configure Ubuntu I'm using the [ubuntu-post-install](https://github.com/tprasadtp/ubuntu-post-install/) project, to install the tools I needed.

Also I have some miscs that not supported in that tool.

To run the tool and the other install, run the `./after-effects/run.sh` file.

Configure the `ubuntu-post-install` by editing the `./after-effects/config.yml`.

Configure the rest installs by the documentation inside the `./after-effects/run.sh`.

# TODO

 - [] Create scripts for Windows and/or PowerShell
 - [] Register `./configs/git-aliases`
 - [] Install [`pyradio`](https://github.com/coderholic/pyradio)
